# Beginner AI Projects

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains simple AI projects that I created as a beginner to practice and build foundational skills in machine learning and deep learning.

## Projects

### 1. MNIST Digit Classifier

- **Dataset**: [MNIST Digits Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset?resource=download)
- **Description**: A basic image classification model built using Keras to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - Neural Networks
  - Computer Vision
  - Keras and TensorFlow
- **Status**: ✅ Completed


### 2. Fashion MNIST Classifier

- **Dataset**: [Fashion MNIST Dataset (Kaggle)]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist])
- **Description**: A deep learning model built using Keras to classify grayscale images of clothing items (e.g., shirts, shoes, bags) from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Skills Practiced**:
  - Neural Networks
  - Computer Vision
  - Keras and TensorFlow
  - Model Evaluation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. SpaceShip Titanic *(Coming Soon)*

- **Dataset**: TBA
- **Description**: A future project based on the Spaceship Titanic dataset, aiming to build a classification model.
- **Skills to Practice**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Classification models
  - Feature engineering
- **Status**: 🚧 In Progress
